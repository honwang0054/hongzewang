  To enhance the generalizability of the RL agent, we propose an adaptive environment-shaping framework that dynamically adjusts the training environment based on the agent's performance. We achieve this by leveraging a secondary RL policy to design environments that strike a balance between being challenging and achievable, allowing the agent to adapt and improve progressively. Using our adaptive environment shaping, one single racing policy efficiently learns to race in diverse challenging tracks.
