  <p>
    I am a final-year Master's student at ETH Zurich, 
    currently doing my Master's thesis in the Computer Vision and Geometry Group (CVG) 
    led by Prof. Marc Pollefeys. Previously, I completed two semester theses: 
    one in the Robotics and Perception Group (RPG), advised by Prof. Davide Scaramuzza, 
    and another in the Robotic Systems Lab (RSL), led by Prof. Marco Hutter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before joining ETH Zurich, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Automation from Xi'an Jiaotong University. 
    Additionally, I dedicated extra time during my third and fourth undergraduate years to complete a second 
    Bachelor's degree in Financial Engineering, offered jointly by China Construction Bank and XJTU.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests lie in the intersection of robotics and deep learning. 
    I am particularly interested in the application of reinforcement learning to robotics tasks, 
    such as visual navigation, mobile manipulation, and autonomous drone racing.
